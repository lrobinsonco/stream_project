# Stream App

The stream app is an easily readable and mobile first web app for viewing surface water data. This was my first web based app project using a bootstrap framework and making API calls to USGS and Google data.
I wanted to create a mobile forward design for retrieving stream data that was easy to navigate for outdoor enthusiasts. Future design implementations should include a way to store data by date, a full list of stations, and dynamically created graphs.
